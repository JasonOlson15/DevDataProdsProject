In the study 150 cases were collected (50 of each species) and 4 measurements were taken:\n\nSepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width\n\nHere is a quick summary of the data:\n\n```{r}\nsummary(iris)\n```\n\nModel Description\n========================================================\n\nThe model which the application is based on is a Linear Discriminant Analysis and has approximately the following accuracy level:\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nrequire(shiny);\nrequire(caret);\nrequire(e1071);\nrequire(randomForest);\nrequire(nnet);\nrequire(glmnet);\n\nset.seed(11111)\n\ndata(\"iris\")\nfullDataset <- iris\n\n## Create the training and test data set\ninTrain <- createDataPartition(y=fullDataset$Species, p=0.7, list=FALSE)\ntrainDataset <- fullDataset[inTrain,]\ntestDataset <- fullDataset[-inTrain,]\n\n# Generate model and test the accuracy\nmodel_lda <- train(Species~., data=trainDataset, method=\"lda\")\nmodel_lda_Accuracy <- max(model_lda$results$Accuracy)\npredict_lda <- predict(model_lda, testDataset)\ncf_lda <- confusionMatrix(predict_lda, testDataset$Species)\nmodelTest_lda_Accuracy <- cf_lda$overall[\"Accuracy\"]\n\nmodelTest_lda_Accuracy\n```\n\nThe accuracy level is precise enough to quickly get an idea of which species are you are looking at while in the field.\n\nConclusion\n========================================================\nNext time you are out looking at an Iris you'll be able to quickly tell the difference between the species by using the Iris Predication Application.\n\n![alt text](http://middlesexconservation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/irissetosacanadensis.gif)\n![alt text](https://www.ct-botanical-society.org/img/pics_i/irisvers_fl.jpg)\n![alt text](https://www.prairiemoon.com/images/P/iris-virginica-shrevi-southern-blue-flag-flower2.jpg)",
